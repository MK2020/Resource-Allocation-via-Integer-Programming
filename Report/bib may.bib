	title={A constraint programming approach to the hospitals/residents problem},
	publisher={Springer},
	abstract={An instance I of the Hospitals/Residents problem (HR) involves a set of residents (graduating medical students) and a set of hospitals, where each hospital has a given capacity. The residents have preferences for the hospitals, as do hospitals for residents. A solution of I is a stable matching, which is an assignment of residents to hospitals that respects the capacity conditions and preference lists in a precise way. In this paper we present constraint encodings for HR that give rise to important structural properties. We also present a computational study using both randomly-generated and real-world instances. We provide additional motivation for our models by indicating how side constraints can be added easily in order to solve hard variants of HR.},

	journal={Advances in Operations Research},
	volume={2018},
	pages={1-19},
	abstract={This paper presents a review pertaining to assignment problem within the education domain, besides looking into the applications of the present research trend, developments, and publications. Assignment problem arises in diverse situations, where one needs to determine an optimal way to assign n subjects to m subjects in the best possible way. With that, this paper classified assignment problems into two, which are timetabling problem and allocation problem. The timetabling problem is further classified into examination, course, and school timetabling problems, while the allocation problem is divided into student-project allocation, new student allocation, and space allocation problems. Furthermore, the constraints, which are of hard and soft constraints, involved in the said problems are briefly elaborated. In addition, this paper presents various approaches to address various types of assignment problem. Moreover, direction and potential paths of problem solving based on the latest trend of approaches are also highlighted. As such, this review summarizes and records a comprehensive survey regarding assignment problem within education domain, which enhances one’s understanding concerning the varied types of assignment problems, along with various approaches that serve as solution.},

This work tackles an extended version of the problem known as the multimode resource-constrained multiproject scheduling problem. A solution to this problem consists of a schedule of jobs from various projects, so that the job allocations do not exceed the stipulated limits of renewable and nonrenewable resources. To accomplish this, a set of execution modes for the jobs must be chosen, as the jobs' duration and amount of needed resources vary depending on the mode selected. Finally, the schedule must also consider precedence constraints between jobs. This work proposes heuristic methods based on integer programming to solve the PSP considered in the Multidisciplinary International Scheduling Conference: Theory and Applications (MISTA) 2013 Challenge. The developed solver was ranked third in the competition, being able to find feasible and competitive solutions for all instances and improving best known solutions for some problems.},

	pages={1-15},
	abstract={Applied Soft Computing, 2018 The problem of allocating students to supervisors for the development of a personal project or a dissertation is a crucial activity in the higher education environment, as it enables students to get feedback on their work from an expert and improve their personal, academic, and professional abilities. In this article, we propose a multi-objective and near Pareto optimal genetic algorithm for the allocation of students to supervisors. The allocation takes into consideration the students and supervisors' preferences on research/project topics, the lower and upper supervision quotas of supervisors, as well as the workload balance amongst supervisors. We introduce novel mutation and crossover operators for the student-supervisor allocation problem. The experiments carried out show that the components of the genetic algorithm are more apt for the problem than classic components, and that the genetic algorithm is capable of producing allocations that are near Pareto optimal in a reasonable time.},

	journal={Annals of Operations Research},
	pages={1-40},
	abstract={We consider the problem of allocating students to project topics satisfying side constraints and taking into account students’ preferences. Students rank projects according to their preferences for the topic and side constraints limit the possibilities to team up students in the project topics. The goal is to find assignments that are fair and that maximize the collective satisfaction. Moreover, we consider issues of stability and envy from the students’ viewpoint. This problem arises as a crucial activity in the organization of a first year course at the Faculty of Science of the University of Southern Denmark. We formalize the student-project allocation problem as a mixed integer linear programming problem and focus on different ways to model fairness and utilitarian principles. On the basis of real-world data, we compare empirically the quality of the allocations found by the different models and the computational effort to find solutions by means of a state-of-the-art commercial solver. We provide empirical evidence about the effects of these models on the distribution of the student assignments, which could be valuable input for policy makers in similar settings. Building on these results we propose novel combinations of the models that, for our case, attain feasible, stable, fair and collectively satisfactory solutions within a minute of computation. Since 2010, these solutions are used in practice at our institution.},

Among a set of projects, each student indicates a preference list over their eligible projects, while the Department wants to make the most allocations, with its preferences over the individual students according to their GPA's. We apply pre-emptive goal programming to a multi-criteria SPA model for allocating these projects to students with a DSS implementation. The numerical results illustrate the clear effectiveness and efﬁciency of this approach. Keywords  Student Project Allocation; Goal Programming; Decision Support System (DSS)}

	abstract = 	 {The Student-Project Allocation problem with lecturer preferences over Students (SPA-S) involves assigning students to projects based on student preferences over projects, lecturer preferences over students, and the maximum number of students that each project and lecturer can accommodate. This classical model assumes that preference lists are strictly ordered. Here, we study a generalisation of SPA-S where ties are allowed in the preference lists of students and lecturers, which we refer to as the Student-Project Allocation problem with lecturer preferences over Students with Ties (SPA-ST). We investigate stable matchings under the most robust definition of stability in this context, namely super-stability. We describe the first polynomial-time algorithm to find a super-stable matching or to report that no such matching exists, given an instance of SPA-ST. Our algorithm runs in $O(L)$ time, where $L$ is the total length of all the preference lists. Finally, we present results obtained from an empirical evaluation of the linear-time algorithm based on randomly-generated SPA-ST instances. Our main finding is that, whilst super-stable matchings can be elusive, the probability of such a matching existing is significantly higher if ties are restricted to the lecturers' preference lists.},

	abstract={We describe a solution to the student-project allocation problem using simulated annealing. The problem involves assigning students to projects, where each student has ranked a fixed number of projects in order of preference. Each project is offered by a specific supervisor (or supervisors), and the goal is to find an optimal matching of students to projects taking into account the students' preferences, the constraint that only one student can be assigned to a given project, and the constraint that supervisors have a maximum workload. We show that when applied to a real dataset from a university physics department, simulated annealing allows the rapid determination of high quality solutions to this allocation problem. The quality of the solution is quantified by a satisfaction metric derived from empirical student survey data. Our approach provides high quality allocations in a matter of minutes that are as good as those found previously by the course organizer using a laborious trial-and-error approach. We investigate how the quality of the allocation is affected by the ratio of the number of projects offered to the number of students and the number of projects ranked by each student. We briefly discuss how our approach can be generalized to include other types of constraints and discuss its potential applicability to wider allocation problems.},

92% of optimal in all cases, with the percentage being far higher for many instances.},

The approach is estimated to significantly streamline the placement decision process at the college by reducing required man hour as well as the time it takes to announce placement decisions. Compared to the previous manual system where only one or two placement criteria were considered, the new approach allows the college’s management to easily incorporate additional placement criteria, if needed. Comparison of our approach against manually constructed placement decisions based on actual data for the 2012/13 academic year suggested that about 93 percent of the placements from our model concur with the actual placement decisions. For the remaining 7 percent of placements, however, the actual placements made by the manual system display inconsistencies of decisions judged against the very criteria intended to guide placement decisions by the college’s program management office. Overall, the new approach proves to be a significant improvement over the manual system in terms of efficiency of the placement process and the quality of placement decisions.},

	volume = 	 {34},
	abstract = 	 {Abstract. In an instance of size n of the stable maniage problem, each of n men and n women ranks the members of the opposite sex in order of preference. A stable matching is a complete matching of men and women such that no man and woman who are not partners both prefer each other to their actual partners under the matching. It is well known [2] that at least one stable matching exists for every stable marriage instance. However, the classical Gale-Shapley algorithm produces a marriage that greatly favors the men at the expense of the women, or vice versa. The problem  arises of finding a stable matching that is optimal under some more equitable or egalitarian criterion of optimality.  This problem was posed by Knuth  [6] and has remained unsolved for some time. Here, the objective of maximizing the average (or, equivalently,  the total) “satisfaction”  of all people is used. This objective is achieved when a person's satisfaction is measured by the position of his/her partner in his/her preference list. By exploiting  the structure of the set of all stable matchings, and using graph-theoretic methods, an O(n4) algorithm for this problem is derived.

	abstract={  Research projects are graduation requirements for many university students. If students are arbitrarily assigned project supervisors without factoring in the students' preferences, they may be allocated supervisors whose research interests differ from theirs or whom they just do not enjoy working with. In this paper we present a genetic algorithm (GA) for assigning project supervisors to students taking into account the students' preferences for lecturers as well as lecturers' capacities. Our work differs from several existing ones which tackle the student project allocation (SPA) problem. SPA is concerned with assigning research projects to students (and sometimes lecturers), while our work focuses on assigning supervisors to students. The advantage of the latter over the former is that it does not require projects to be available at the time of assignment, thus allowing the students to discuss their own project ideas/topics with supervisors after the allocation. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms GAs that utilize standard selection and crossover operations. Our GA also compares favorably to an optimal integer programming approach and has the added advantage of producing multiple good allocations, which can be discussed in order to adopt a final allocation.},

	abstract={The organization of the labor market for medical interns and residents underwent a number of changes before taking its present form in 1951. The record of these changes and the problems that prompted them provides an unusual opportunity to study the forces at work in markets of this kind. The present paper begins with a brief history and then presents a game-theoretic analysis to explain the orderly operation and longevity of the current market, in contrast to the turmoil that characterized various earlier short-lived attempts to organize the market. An analysis is also given of some contemporary problems facing the market. A subsidiary theme of the paper concerns the history of ideas: the problems encountered in the organization of this market, and some of the solutions arrived at, anticipated the discussion of such issues in the literature of economics and game theory.},

	abstract={The allocation of projects to students is a generic problem in many universities within the UK and elsewhere, not only in engineering but also in various other disciplines. This paper defines the student project allocation problem explicitly by an objective function and a number of constraints. Two integer program models are presented, the first of which is a dynamic program. A general purpose solver is used to solve the models, and the input files are included in the Appendix. The models are computationally efficient and easily solved on a PC. Important issues in interpreting the model outputs are highlighted. As with any optimization problem it is possible for constraints to be too tight to permit any feasible solution. Application of the models is demonstrated by using data from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Southampton, for the academic year 2001-2002. The model has been used successfully to allocate Individual Project and Group Project to students and is likely to become the defacto method of allocation of projects in the future. This paper demonstrates how operations research techniques used widely in optimizing use of resources can be applied in education.},

	abstract={The Student-Project Allocation problem with preferences over Projects (SPA-P) involves sets of students, projects and lecturers, where the students and lecturers each have preferences over the projects. In this context, we typically seek a stable matching of students to projects (and lecturers). However, these stable matchings can have different sizes, and the problem of finding a maximum stable matching (MAX-SPA-P) is NP-hard. There are two known approximation algorithms for MAX-SPA-P, with performance guarantees of 2 and 3/2. In this paper, we describe an Integer Programming (IP) model to enable MAX-SPA-P to be solved optimally. Following this, we present results arising from an empirical analysis that investigates how the solution produced by the approximation algorithms compares to the optimal solution obtained from the IP model, with respect to the size of the stable matchings constructed, on instances that are both randomly-generated and derived from real datasets. Our main finding is that the 3/2-approximation algorithm finds stable matchings that are very close to having maximum cardinality. 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract={Prioritizing and making decisions on what student activities to be selected and conducted to fulfill the aspiration of a university as translated in its strategic plan must be executed with transparency and accountability. It is becoming even more crucial, particularly for universities in Malaysia with the recent budget cut imposed by the Malaysian government. In this paper, we illustrated how 0-1 integer programming (0-1 IP) model was implemented to select which activities among the forty activities proposed by the student body of Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) to be implemented for the 2017/2018 academic year. Two different models were constructed. The first model was developed to determine the minimum total budget that should be given to the student body by the UUM management to conduct all the activities that can fulfill the minimum targeted number of activities as stated in its strategic plan. On the other hand, the second model was developed to determine which activities to be selected based on the total budget already allocated beforehand by the UUM management towards fulfilling the requirements as set in its strategic plan. The selection of activities for the second model, was also based on the preference of the members of the student body whereby the preference value for each activity was determined using Compromised-Analytical Hierarchy Process. The outputs from both models were compared and discussed. The technique used in this study will be useful and suitable to be implemented by organizations with key performance indicator-oriented programs and having limited budget allocation issues.},

	abstract={We consider the following problem of course scheduling and assignment of students. Students express their preferences for each course from several sets of proposed courses and each student has to take a certain number of courses from each set. A minimum number of students is required to open a course and a maximum number of students is specified for each course. The courses have to be scheduled on a limited number of periods so that simultaneous courses have no students in common. This problem can be seen as a generalization of the Student Project Allocation problem. It consists in determining which courses to open, specifying the schedule for these opened courses, and assigning students to them, so that their preferences are maximized. Our model is an Integer Programming problem, which we solve with a common available solver using an iterative process.}

	abstract={As a support to the backend storage, the content caching technique is of great importance to online social networks (e.g., Facebook), in reducing the request service latency and improving user satisfaction. However, the limited caching capacity and booming user data pose great challenges for the content-cache allocation. In this paper, we propose a three-layer content caching model, and focus on how to efficiently allocation contents to caches in order to minimize the overall service latency. We try to tackle this issue by utilizing both centralized Mix Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization and by modeling it as a distributed student admission (SA) stable matching problem. In the SA model, we leverage the resident-oriented Gale-Shapley (RGS) algorithm to yield a stable matching between contents and cache centers. We compare the performance between the centralized and distributed algorithms in terms of system welfare and computation analysis. Through numerical results, we prove the effectiveness of our proposed methods. 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract={Course allocation is one of the most complex issues facing any university, due to the sensitive nature of deciding which subset of students should be granted seats in highly-popular (market-scarce) courses. In recent years, researchers have proposed numerous solutions, using techniques in integer programming, combinatorial auction design, and matching theory. In this paper, we present a four-part Al-based course allocation algorithm that was conceived by an undergraduate student, and recently implemented at a small Canadian liberal arts university. This new allocation process, which builds upon the Harvard Business School Draft, has received overwhelming support from students and faculty for its transparency, impartiality, and effectiveness.

	abstract={Many university degree programs (including chemical engineering ones) require final year students and Masters’ students to do an extended research project under the supervision of an academic staff member. However, obtaining a satisfying allocation for both students and supervisors is often a challenging task, especially when the amount of available supervisors is particularly tight and their popularities are highly diverse.In this article we propose a novel method based on a ranked list of supervisors and categories provided by each student, where a category corresponds to a general research area, incorporating this information into the allocation process. A student’s satisfaction may therefore correspond to getting a project either with a highly ranked supervisor and/or in a highly ranked category. With this information, we propose here a systematic approach that relies on a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model based on a flexible definition of students’ satisfaction. Our MILP overcomes the limitations of manual allocation approaches, which when applied to large cohorts are highly time consuming and may produce suboptimal solutions leading to poor satisfaction levels. This MILP has been applied successfully in the School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science of The University of Manchester with increased levels of student satisfaction.},
