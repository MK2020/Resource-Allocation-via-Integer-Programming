**Abstract:**\
This paper takes a Binary Integer Programming (BIP) approach to solving the general
resource allocation problem faced in various industries such as manufacturing in production
planning and finance in portfolio selection. The goal is optimizing the allocation of finite
resources to specific tasks to minimize cost or maximize profit. This problem is widely
approached using Linear Programming, as such, the challenge is tackling the same problem
with a narrower scope of BIP which has been practiced far less often in literature as it
constricts the problem to binary variables. As a paradigm in this general scope, the focus is
the ‘Student Project Allocation’ problem faced ubiquitously in higher education institutions
where individual projects are often a graduation requirement. Initially, this problem considers
the preferences of the students solely, and later incorporates the lecturers’ capacities of
supervision. This paper shows that utilization of Integer Programming performs faster and
more efficiently, yielding higher rates of both student and lecturer satisfaction compared
to existing methods used to solve resource allocation problems such as gradient descent
algorithms, the Hungarian method, and complete enumeration. Finally, this paper highlights
the applications of the aforementioned method in other industries and related challenges with
this approach.
